		<h1>Andrew Keenan, Ph.D</h1>

		<p>I am an Instructor at NorQuest College in the Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada program. I am interested in innovative approaches for adult education that meet students in their own cultural context. I believe we are all experts. I want to reframe education to express that belief. Education should empower us to develop and share our individual expertise in new and interesting ways. I have a Ph.D from the University of Toronto in the Faculty of Information where I studied human computer interaction, information practice, and user experience.</p>
