			<h2><a href="http://digitalzombies.ucr.edu/">Digital Zombies</a></h2> <p>Digital Zombies is a scalable and interactive game designed to address significant needs in student preparedness and digital literacy. Independent research activities are broken into a series of smaller tasks that follow sequentially in a historical narrative around a fictional “digital zombie outbreak.” Students interact with physical and digital built-environments provoking interactions with people, physical and digital or digitized library materials, search engines, and social media. The game ties libraries into a specific course curriculum, making them an integral part of the exploration of digital narratives, collaborative and individual writing, and also hybrid research methods, all of which successfully engages students beyond the traditional course curriculum. Over 1000 students have participated in this game across the University of California system.</p>
