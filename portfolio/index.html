			<h2><a href="http://digitalzombies.ucr.edu/">Digital Zombies</a></h2> <p>Digital Zombies is a scalable and interactive game designed to address significant needs in student preparedness and digital literacy. Independent research activities are broken into a series of smaller tasks that follow sequentially in a historical narrative around a fictional “digital zombie outbreak.” Students interact with physical and digital built-environments provoking interactions with people, physical and digital or digitized library materials, search engines, and social media. The game ties libraries into a specific course curriculum, making them an integral part of the exploration of digital narratives, collaborative and individual writing, and also hybrid research methods, all of which successfully engages students beyond the traditional course curriculum. Over 1000 students have participated in this game across the University of California system.</p>

        <p>Root of Play is a card game to help game designers create prototypes in a short amount of time. The game is intended for designers at various levels of expertise. Root of Play combine the action of game playing and game making into a structured activity. It helps participants realize the complex theoretical components of games and gameplay through an active design and play testing process. Root of Play is structured around the concept of creativity through constraint. Players are given specific and clear parameters for game design and develop prototype games based on these constraints. These operate in two ways: 1. limited number of cards for idea generation; 2. limited amount of time. Within 30 minutes, players develop and pitch a game concept which can then be expanded into a full-scale playable prototype.</p>
