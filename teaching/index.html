<h2>Student Testimonials</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>"I took an excellent summer course with you in 2015 on games in humanities classrooms.  That experience still enriches my teaching -- to the point that I'm offering a new course on games here." - DHSI participant, faculty member.</p>



<li><p>"Matt Bouchard and Andy Keenan, the fearless leaders and diabolical geniuses behind our Games for Digital Humanists course at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute 2014 at the University of Victoria in British Columbia.Matt and Andy dreamt up both the course and the game design exercise that let us formulate Reunion in the first place. We (quite literally) couldn't have done it without them. (It didn't hurt that they were fantastic teachers and teaching a fantastic course, either.) So really, what we're saying is that this is kind of their fault. The entire class of Games for Digital Humanities (shout out, #GamesDH!), for their creative input, lively discussions, and general excellence as people to hang out with. The encouragement and creative atmosphere really made the difference. (And they didn't even really judge us all that much for being such obviously sick people. What does that say about them?)" - <a href="http://reunionthegame.com/">The Reunion: A Storytelling card game</a> that was developed during DHSI 2013 by three class participants.</p>
