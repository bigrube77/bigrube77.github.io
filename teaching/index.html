<h2>Student Testimonials</h2>

<ol>
    <li>"I took an excellent summer course with you in 2015 on games in humanities classrooms.  That experience still enriches my teaching -- to the point that I'm offering a new course on games here." - DHSI participant

    <li>"Matt Bouchard and Andy Keenan, the fearless leaders and diabolical geniuses behind our Games for Digital Humanists course at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute 2014 at the University of Victoria in British Columbia.Matt and Andy dreamt up both the course and the game design exercise that let us formulate Reunion in the first place. We (quite literally) couldn't have done it without them. (It didn't hurt that they were fantastic teachers and teaching a fantastic course, either.) So really, what we're saying is that this is kind of their fault. The entire class of Games for Digital Humanities (shout out, #GamesDH!), for their creative input, lively discussions, and general excellence as people to hang out with. The encouragement and creative atmosphere really made the difference. (And they didn't even really judge us all that much for being such obviously sick people. What does that say about them?)" - DHSI participants, creators of <a href="http://reunionthegame.com/">The Reunion: A Storytelling card game</a>

    <li>"Outstanding mix of theory and hands-on experience. Well structured. Gets students designing games and
    practicing iterative development right away and with a minimum of fuss and near microscopic levels of muss.
    Offered useful practical device about developing games, seeking grants, etc." - DHSI Participant

    <li>"Even as someone with a background in games and game/design theory, I found an incredible amount of new
    information in this course, and Matt and Andy tied it all together with a great command of their material and a
    very well-chosen set of example games to help anchor the theory in practical examples. From conversations
    with the other participants in the class, everyone in the class seemed to understand the material and find it
    incredibly useful, and everyone has had only the strongest praise for Matt and Andy both as instructors." - DHSI Participant

    <li>"Matt and Andy were both extremely knowledgable about their topics and were able to effectively, clearly,
    and passionately present information. They both showed genuine interest in the conversations and lectures
    and demonstrated honest love of their subjects. The course was open enough to allow for incredible
    flexibility within the individual conversations but structured enough to have obvious direction. It was casual
    which allowed there to be an amazing about of flow between participants coming from different
    backgrounds. We were able to laugh about our differences as well as collaborate on shared experiences.
    Even as someone with no experience with games, I was able to learn an incredible amount, both from Matt
    and Andy and from the other group members." - DHSI Participant

    <li>"Matt & Andy are a phenomenal team - the entire course and their leadership through it is exemplary. The
    most amazing thing - and I can only say that in hindsight, is that the course is modeled on the topic of the
    workshop: their class is a perfect game! The incentives are right, the learning happens intuitively, we are
    given the opportunity to explore, fail, learn, improve. And at the end of the class/game, everyone wins!" - DHSI Participant

    <li>"Both instructors are very enthusiastic and knowledgable about this topic. Playing a variety of games and then critically discussing as a group was valuable. I liked having "game studies" as we'll as "game design" separated as two different areas of study. I am inspired to read more on gameplay studies and play more games!"" - DHSI Participant

    <li>"Without question, Matt and Andy constituted the strenghts of the course. They are exceptional instructors,
    well-mathced intellectually and professionally as team-teachers, and they deftly handled the course material and discussions that arose over the course of the workshop." - DHSI Participant

    <li>"I am deeply impressed with the intellectual scope and breadth that Matt and Andy possess, and their ability to
    effectively communicate a complex topic to a diverse class (ranging from new to seasoned gamers). They also
    brought their own professional and personal experiences to bear upon the subjects covered, especially useful were
    their discussion about project management and interpersonal communication in project scenarios (success and failure stories). They are talented teachers." - DHSI Participant

    <li>"This was an amazing course! Andy and Matt were very well prepared, and geared the course discussion appropriately to the level of expertise within the class. The class was a very good mix of theory, practical group exercises, discussion, and hands-on development work. I learned a great deal." - DHSI Participant
